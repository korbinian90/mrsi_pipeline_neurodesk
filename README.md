# Compiled MATLAB and bash scripts for MRSI (from Wolfgang Bogner group)

## Neurodesk Explanation

[Neurodesk](https://www.neurodesk.org/) is a browser accessible, docker-based environment containing multiple neuro-processing pipelines. The computation is performed locally, while the docker images are streamed from an online storage. A virtual desktop can be accessed via the browser and supports GUIs.

After installing Neurodesk, this reconstruction is directly available via the `ml mrsi_proc` command.
