%%%%% FIRST ORDER PHASE:
%%%%% if 2 metabolites have circle freq w1, w2 and a phase 0. order of ph0 and they are measured with acquisition delay t
%%%%% then their phases in rad are:
%%%%% phw1(t) = ph0 + w1*t
%%%%% phw2(t) = ph0 + w2*t
%%%%% so their phase difference is delta_ph[rad] = (w2-w1)*t
%%%%% the acq delay is then t = delta_ph[rad]/(w2-w1) in seconds, converted to degree/ppm it is 
%%%%% t [s] = delta_ph[rad]/(w2-w1) = delta_ph[rad]/((f2-f1)*2pi) = delta_ph[rad]/(ppm_difference*297.223*10^6*2pi);  (297.223 @ 7T !)
%%%%% so assuming ppm_difference = 2ppm and a delta_ph[rad]=0.05236rad  equal to 3deg --> 1stOrderPhase = 0.0262 rad/ppm equal to 1.5 deg/ppm
%%%%% this leads to an acq delay of: t ~ 0.014 ms; 
%%%%% so such an deviation (because of wrong basis file or technical inaccuracy) can be compensated
